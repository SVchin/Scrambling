In the previous simulations, we see that in some coupling we have periodic 


_____________________________________________________

In these simulations, we introduce additional fields. One in the z-direction and one in the x-direction. This has been shown to introduce non-integrability in the system. Thus, in some cases where we got periodic variation in evolution of discord/otoc, we may expect that the introduction of these additional fields may lead to non-revival of these quantities in time. 

Note : The two fields have the same coupling/magnitude (J_ni = 17)

These additional fields are given by the hamiltonian H_ni in the python code

We study the following cases :

- Additional fields on all qubits (tf on all spins)
	+ Additional fields always turned on
	+ Additional fields turned on only during scrambling time

- Additional fields only on two layers of environment (tf on environment only)
	+ Additional fields always turned on
	+ Additional fields turned on only duringscrambling time
