This is the scenario which indeed gives the behaviour that we had predicted.

In the case of discord, we see a clear decay.

However, in this case we also see a clear decay and loss of periodicity in the time evolution of OTOC.

Common features : 
Decay and loss of periodicity of both quantities.

It seems that the value that the quantity saturates to (after oscillations) is dependant on the intial 't'
